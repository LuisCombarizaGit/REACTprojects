# CoronoVirus web application 

This website project will show live Coronovirus data and model it using a JS library. The idea is to show : (1. Number of cases per country), (2. Number of recoveries / coutry),
(3. Number of deaths/ country), (4. Number of vaccinated/ country). The website allows users to specify what data they want to see and in what format.
